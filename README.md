Caesar Cipher Game in Python

Embark on a journey through ancient cryptography with 
my Python-developed Caesar Cipher Game! This interactive 
program allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages using 
the classic Caesar Cipher technique, where each letter in the 
plaintext is shifted a fixed number of places down or up the alphabet. 
The game features an intuitive interface, making it easy to input your 
messages and choose your desired shift values. Whether you're a history 
buff, a coding enthusiast, or simply curious about cryptography, 
this game offers a fun and educational way to explore one of the oldest 
encryption methods. Step into the shoes of Julius Caesar and experience 
the art of secret communication firsthand!
